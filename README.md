# Trapezoidal Method. 
* We  approximate the definite integral of $f()$ by that if $f_1()$ over the same range. 
* Geometrically, the trapezoidal rule is equivalent to approximating the area of the 
trapezoid under the straight line connecting $f(a)$ and $f(b)$

* To approximate it, you can take the `average` value of $f^{"}(x)$ over $[a,b]$ which will simply be:
$$\bar{f^{"}(\epsilon)} = \frac{f'(b)-f'(a)}{b-a}$$
* The error is zero for every linear function 
* We derive it using the Taylor Series that obviously assumes $b$ and $a$ are close.

# Multiple application / composite integration formulas
* Basically divide it into many segments 
* For division into $n$ segments, we have 
$$h = \frac{b-a}{n}$$

* Note that there are $(n+1)$ points in the expression for $I$ 
* NOTE:This is clearly different from Midpoint Rule. In Midpoint rule we approximate as `Rectangles` with height as $\frac{f(x_i)+f(x_{i+1})}{2}$ and width, obviosuly $(x_{i+1}-x_i)$. 
* The formual for both however, is the smae as the area of the `trapezium` and the rectangle considered in `midpoint` method are the same
